Respected Sir/Madam, <br>
Subject: Problems related to decisions taken by KSLU, Hubballi, Karnataka. <br>
Ref: <br>
Notification – KSLU/Exam/2020/253 (Dated August 13, 2020)<br>
UGC revised guidelines on examination and academic calendar for the Universities in view of Covid-19 pandemic.<br>
Government of Karnataka order no.ED/197/UNE/2020, Bangalore dated 10-07-2020.<br>
<br>
We, the students of colleges affiliated to Karnataka State Law University, Hubballi, Karnataka are expressing our discontent regarding the decisions taken by KSLU with respect to our semester end examinations for the intermediate course and would like to inform you about the same. <br>
The decision (tentative) to reopen colleges from the 1st of September, 2020 and conducting examinations from the 14th of September, 2020 for final years and the 21st of September, 2020 for all intermediate students is a decision we strongly condemn and is a decision which is very treacherous, due to the explicit fact that it is potentially putting the students’, teaching and non-teaching staffs’ life in jeopardy. We would like to state that the COVID-19 cases are increasing in Karnataka at an unprecedented rate and have engulfed every corner of the State and public health experts say the cases would peak during September.<br>
Writing examinations in this grave situation is very dangerous to students’ and their families’ health. It’ll also create mental stress/pressure followed by other complications; affecting students’ well being. <br>
The offline student–teacher interactive classes for the current semester started from 11thof February, 2020 and ended on 7th March, 2020 and only 15% to 20% of the curriculum was completed. The remainder of the curriculum was done through online classes which were not accessible to each and every individual enrolled in a KSLU affiliated college, and most students have incurred difficulties in comprehending the classes conducted online.<br>
Students from across the country come to Bangalore or Karnataka to study law under KSLU. As the dates are announced for the examinations, they need to travel from their hometowns, through means of public transportation (which isn’t safe at this period of time). On arrival to Karnataka, they are required to quarantine themselves in private hotels (hostels and PGs are shut down) which is an economical burden on these students. <br>
<br>
<b>Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, we are under lockdown. The Students are facing a plethora of hindrances owing to the Pandemic, some of them are follows −</b><br>
The online classes which are being conducted are not accessible by everyone due to various deficiencies like lack of stable internet connection, unable to have access to a smartphone or laptop, exorbitant data charges and a significant number of us hail from rural backgrounds, where the network coverage and power supply are unreliable.<br>
Not every student is the same and it would be difficult for students to grasp every aspect of the syllabus taught online, moreover it is unusual and unconventional for us to be studying analytical subjects through an online platform which were originally intended to be taught in the conventional way, which adds to the encumbrances.<br>
As many of the students are from far off places ,it becomes very difficult for them to travel, due to this there will be chaos among students and it would be a logistical challenge for the institution to accommodate those who are not residents of the city (Hostels are shut down and many PGs have also been shut down). Coming to Bangalore, they need to quarantine themselves in private hotels which is an economical burden on students.Many students rely on the college library to study, unfortunately, they aren’t possible to access,and are required to get their study materials, which aren’t available in their hometowns.<br>
The security of the online platform used for conducting these classes are questionable, namely the Zoom application, which as per the guidelines issued by the government must not be used as it could compromise the user’s data. Regardless of such warnings, many lecturers still continue to use it to conduct classes/meetings. Due to the crisis many families are facing economic problems and are struggling to lead their lives. It is pertinently difficult for many of the students to pay their college fees, university fees and their examination fees.<br>
<br><b>These are the requirements for KSLU to implement: </b><br>
We humbly request KSLU at least 8 weeks of Offline classes before conducting the examinations.<br>
<b>Please do not</b> conduct examinations until this crisis comes under control.<br>
<b>Many Universities across the country</b> have adopted a one-time policy in which students of all semester except those in their final year would be promoted based on the performance in the previous semesters. We urge KSLU to adopt the same policy as a one time only scheme (all degree students, professional degree courses like Engineering are already promoted as per GOK order no.ED/197/UNE/2020, Bangalore dated 10-07-2020).<br>
<b>Issue circulars to colleges</b> to use secured online platforms for online meetings and classes.<br>
If exams are conducted against students’ will,then please ensure us the following –<br>
KSLU must ensure the quarantine for students from various states is done at free of cost and done effectively.<br>
KSLU must assure that it shall pay the medical expenses of the student and student’s family if he/she is infected from the virus due to attending the examination.<br>
If any deaths occur due to the infection, KSLU should take complete responsibility and compensate the family as KSLU is offering “LIFE OR EXAM” during the crisis.<br>
<b>Certain percentages of concession</b> must be given to college fees, and all university fees and exam fees must be waived off in view of the bad economic situation.<br>
Hence, we humbly request you to consider the safety as well as physical and mental well-being of the students before any final decision is made and we also believe the decision makers would make a decision that is favourable to all stakeholders.<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
Students of KSLU<br>

<div id="demoFont">The Karnataka State Law University on Thursday released a notification (KSLU/Exam/2020/253) stating that the offline exams for the intermediate courses of law would commence from September 21, 2020.  Preceding to the said notification are alarming number of COVID-19 cases in the state, the UGC and the Bar Council Press Release which provided for promoting studnets based on their internal marks and previous semester marks. The state university is all set to have their exams having released the fee structure for the said exams as well. This created massive uproar and sense of panic amongst students given that they have been confronted with options of choosing life or exams. 

With this letter, we request and ask of the KSLU to cancel the scheduled exams or postpone them to a later date considering the how the spread of the pandemic escalates or descalates or take any step favourable taking into account the best interests of the students as per the guidelines laid down by the UGC and the BCI.</div>
